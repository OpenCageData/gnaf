# gnaf
Components of this project:

1. A script loads the [G-NAF data set](http://www.data.gov.au/dataset/geocoded-national-address-file-g-naf) into a relational database.
2. A [Scala](http://scala-lang.org/) program queries the database to produce JSON to load into a search engine.
3. A script runs the Scala program, transforms the output to suit [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/)'s 'bulk' API and loads the data.
4. A web page queries the Elasticsearch index.

## Install Tools

To run the Scala code install:
- a JRE e.g. from openjdk-7 or 8;
- the build tool [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).

To develop [Scala](http://scala-lang.org/) code install:
- the above items (you may prefer to install the full JDK instead of just the JRE but I think the JRE is sufficient);
- the [Scala IDE](http://scala-ide.org/download/current.html).

Run `sbt update-classifiers` to download dependencies including the H2 database engine used in the next section.

## Create Database

The scripts described here automate the procedure described in the [getting started guide](https://www.psma.com.au/sites/default/files/g-naf_-_getting_started_guide.pdf).
See also https://github.com/minus34/gnaf-loader as an alternative (which makes some modifications to the data).

### Download, Unpack & Generate SQL
Running:

    src/main/script/createGnafDb.sh

- downloads the G-NAF zip file to `data/` (if not found);
- unzips to `data/unzipped/` (if not found); and
- writes SQL to create the H2 database to `data/createGnafDb.sql` (`createGnafDb.sh` would require adaptation for other databases).

### Start Database Engine & SQL Client
The [H2](http://www.h2database.com/) database engine is started with:

    java -jar ~/.ivy2/cache/com.h2database/h2/jars/h2-1.4.191.jar

(the H2 jar file was put here by `sbt update-classifiers`, alternatively download the jar from the H2 web site and run it as above).
This:
- starts a web server on port 8082 serving the SQL client application (it should also open http://127.0.1.1:8082/login.jsp in a web browser);
- starts a tcp/jdbc server on port 9092; and
- starts a postgres protocol server on port 5435 (note this is different from the default port used by Postgres 5432).

The database engine is stopped with `Ctrl-C` (but not yet as it's needed for the next step).

### Run SQL
In the SQL client, enter JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:file:~/sw/gnaf/data/gnaf`, User name: `gnaf` and Password: `gnaf`) and click `Connect` to create an empty database at this location.
This is a single file, zero-admin database. It can me moved/renamed simply by moving/renaming the `gnaf.mv.db` file.


Run the SQL commands either by:
- entering: `RUNSCRIPT FROM '~/sw/gnaf/data/createGnafDb.sql'` into the SQL input area (this method displays no indication of progress); or
- pasting the content of this file into the SQL input area (this method displays what is going on).

On a macbook-pro (with SSD) it takes 26 min to load the data and another 53 min to create the indexes.
The script creates a user `READONLY` with password `READONLY` that has only the `SELECT` right. This user should be used for read-only access.

### Example Queries
Find me (fast):

    SELECT SL.*, AD.*
    FROM
        STREET_LOCALITY SL
        LEFT JOIN ADDRESS_DETAIL AD ON AD.STREET_LOCALITY_PID = SL.STREET_LOCALITY_PID  
    WHERE SL.STREET_NAME = 'TYTHERLEIGH'
        AND AD.NUMBER_FIRST = 14

This is slow (45892 ms):

    SELECT * FROM ADDRESS_VIEW 
    WHERE STREET_NAME = 'TYTHERLEIGH'
    AND NUMBER_FIRST = 14

but at least this is fast:

    SELECT * FROM ADDRESS_VIEW 
    WHERE ADDRESS_DETAIL_PID = 'GAACT714928273'

This shows some dodgy STREET_LOCALITY_ALIAS records:

    SELECT sl.STREET_NAME, sl.STREET_TYPE_CODE, sl.STREET_SUFFIX_CODE,
      sla.STREET_NAME, sla.STREET_TYPE_CODE , sla.STREET_SUFFIX_CODE 
    FROM STREET_LOCALITY_ALIAS sla, STREET_LOCALITY sl
    WHERE sla.STREET_LOCALITY_PID = sl.STREET_LOCALITY_PID
    AND sl.STREET_NAME = 'REED'
        
    STREET_NAME     STREET_TYPE_CODE    STREET_SUFFIX_CODE      STREET_NAME     STREET_TYPE_CODE    STREET_SUFFIX_CODE  
    REED            STREET              S                       REED STREET     SOUTH               null
    REED            STREET              N                       REED STREET     NORTH               null

## Generate Slick bindings
[Slick](http://slick.typesafe.com/) provides "Functional Relational Mapping for Scala".
To generate Slick mappings for the database (first disconnect any other clients):

    mkdir -p generated
    sbt
    > console
    slick.codegen.SourceCodeGenerator.main(
        Array("slick.driver.H2Driver", "org.h2.Driver", "jdbc:h2:file:~/sw/gnaf/data/gnaf", "generated", "au.com.data61.gnaf.db")
    )

This generates code in the `generated/au/com/data61/db` directory.
At this stage its not clear whether the mapping will:
1. need hand tweaks (i.e. once off generation then its part of the source code); or
2. not need hand tweaks and should be generated by the build and is not part of our source code (better if schema changes much/often).

For now we'll opt for 1 and move this into `src/main/scala`.
There has been an unsuccessful attempt at using [sbt-slick-codegen](https://github.com/tototoshi/sbt-slick-codegen)
for option 2 (see comments in `project/plugins.sbt`).

## Create Elasticsearch Index
Running:

    src/main/script/loadElasticSearch.sh

builds and runs the Scala program, transforms the output to suit Elasticsearch's 'bulk' API and loads the data to create an Elasticsearch index. Dependencies:
- Elasticsearch must be running on http://localhost:9200 (that is its default port);
- the JSON transformation tool [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) must be installed.

## Example Elasticsearch Queries

Search for an exact match:

    $ curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/gnaf/_search?pretty' -d '
    {
      "query": { "match": { "street.name": "CURRONG" } },
      "size": 5
    }' 

Search for a fuzzy match against all fields:
        
    $ curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/gnaf/_search?pretty' -d '
    {
      "query": { "match": { "_all": { "query": "CURRONGT",  "fuzziness": 1, "prefix_length": 2 } } },
      "size": 5
    }' 

## Client Apps

### Elasticsearch CORS Support

Access by the client apps requires [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) to be configured in Elasticsearch.
Append to `config/elasticsearch.yml`:

    http.cors.enabled: true
    http.cors.allow-origin: "*"
        
then restart Elasticsearch.

### Web Page
The web page `src/main/webapp/index.html` provides a user interface to query the Elasticsearch index.

### Command Line
The [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) command line client require node's `request` module, which is installed with:

    npm install request
    
Run the [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) command line client with:

    node src/main/webapp/main.js

It reads lines from stdin purporting to be an address and writes the top Elasticsearch match as JSON to stdout.

Example usage:

This didn't work:

    zcat ../dibpMail/data.tsv.gz | cut -f29-30,32,33  | node src/main/webapp/main.js > dibpMailAddresses
    Error { [Error: connect EADDRNOTAVAIL 127.0.0.1:9200 - Local (127.0.0.1:0)]
    
but this works OK:

    zcat ../dibpMail/data.tsv.gz | cut -f29-30,32,33  | while read a; do echo $a | node src/main/webapp/main.js; done > dibpMailAddresses

## Notes on the H2 database

If an [H2](http://www.h2database.com/) result set contains more than
[MAX_MEMORY_ROWS](http://www.h2database.com/html/grammar.html?highlight=max_memory_rows&search=MAX_MEMORY_ROWS#set_max_memory_rows),
it is spooled to disk before the first row is provided to the client.
The default is 40000 per GB of available RAM and setting a non-default value requires database admin rights (which we prefer to avoid using).
Analysis in comments in `Main.scala` shows that we need to handle result sets up to 95,004 rows, so allocating up to 3GB of heap (with `java -Xmx3G`) should avoid spooling.

## Field Statistics
- non null numberLast: 1,121,843 out of 14,126,043
- flatNumber prefix length 2, 14,099,611 nulls; suffix length 2, 4,017,287 nulls, both with lots of letter and number combinations
- level prefix length 2, 14,123,096 nulls; suffix length 2, 14,125,593 nulls
- numberFirst prefix length 3, 14,122,945 nulls; suffix length 2, 13,493,586 nulls
- numberLast prefix length 3; suffix length 2

## To Do
Add some pointers to H2 doco showing how to start a H2 with a Postgres protocol listener and connect to it with psql Postgres client. That may be a more convenient way to run `createGnafDb.sql`. Note psql cannot connect with blank username and password, so you need to create a user and grant it suitable rights.
