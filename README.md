# gnaf

## Introduction
This project:

- loads the [G-NAF data set](http://www.data.gov.au/dataset/geocoded-national-address-file-g-naf) into a relational database and search engine;
- provides JSON web services to access the database and search engine; and
- provides a demonstration web user interface using the web services.

Users of the search web service `gnaf-search` should note the [suggested preprocessing](gnaf-lucene/README.md#suggested-preprocessing-for-client-applications] for
query strings.

## Project Structure
These sub-directories contain sub-projects:

1. gnaf-util: common code
2. gnaf-db: scripts to load the [G-NAF data set](http://www.data.gov.au/dataset/geocoded-national-address-file-g-naf) into a relational database
and [Slick](http://slick.typesafe.com/) "Functional Relational Mapping" bindings for the database.
The README.md discusses the H2 database and G-NAF data.
3. gnaf-extractor: queries the database to produce JSON address data
4. gnaf-lucene: common code for indexing and searching G-NAF with [Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/).
The README.md discusses the search techniques used.
5. gnaf-indexer: loads JSON address data into a [Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/) index
6. gnaf-search: JSON web service to search the [Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/) index
7. gnaf-test: queries the database to produce test address data with many variations, scripts to perform bulk lookups of the test data and evaluate results
8. gnaf-db-service: JSON web service providing access to the G-NAF database
9. gnaf-contrib: a JSON web service providing access to the gnafContrib database of user supplied geocodes
10. gnaf-ui: static files providing a demonstration web user interface using gnaf-search, gnad-db-service and gnaf-contrib.

Nature of Sub-projects:

- 1, 2 & 4 produce a jar file of library code used by other sub-projects
- 3, 5 & 7 produce command line programs packaged as a [onejar](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-onejar).
This is a jar file containing all dependencies and run simply with: `java -jar {filename.jar}`
- 6, 8 & 9 produce JSON web services also packaged as a [onejar](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-onejar).
These are run as above (not in a servlet container).

The top level directory provides:
- the [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) build for the [Scala](http://scala-lang.org/) code in projects 1-9 (no build is required for 10); and
- [src/main/script/run.sh](src/main/script/run.sh) to run everything, but first:
  - take a look as its intended as executable documentation and you may not wish to run it all each time
  - install tools

## Install Tools

To run the Scala code install:
- a JRE e.g. from openjdk-8 (version 8 or higher is required by some dependencies);
- the build tool [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).

To develop [Scala](http://scala-lang.org/) code install:
- the above items (you may prefer to install the full JDK instead of just the JRE but I think the JRE is sufficient);
- the [Scala IDE](http://scala-ide.org/download/current.html).

### Dependencies

- scripts assume a *nix environment
- [src/main/script/run.sh](src/main/script/run.sh) requires the Postgres client `psql` to load the database (see [gnaf-db](gnaf-db) for an alternative method using the h2 client)
- [gnaf-test](gnaf-test) has additional dependencies - see its README

## Running and Usage

See [src/main/script/run.sh](src/main/script/run.sh).

## Build

Automatic builds are available at: https://t3as-jenkins.it.csiro.au/ (only within the CSIRO network).

The command:

    sbt clean test one-jar dumpLicenseReport

from the project's top level directory cleans out previous build products, runs unit tests,
builds one-jar files and creates license reports on dependencies.

## Develop With Eclipse

The command:

    sbt update-classifiers eclipse

uses the [sbteclipse](https://github.com/typesafehub/sbteclipse/wiki/Using-sbteclipse) plugin to create the .project and .classpath files required by Eclipse (with source attachments for dependencies).
